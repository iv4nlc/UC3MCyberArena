# MAYDAY!

You've just intercepted an emergency transmission from a distress call, possibly from a stranded or lost individual in need of help. The call came through a secure channel, but the message seems to be encoded. The person seems to be in serious trouble, but the details of their location and situation are unclear.
Itâ€™s up to you to decipher their message, find out where they are, and help save them.
