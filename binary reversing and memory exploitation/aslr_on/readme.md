Congratulations on making it this far! By now, youâ€™ve become familiar with several tools for binary reversing. You're about to face a more realistic challenge. This time, ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) will be enabled, making your task even more difficult.

Just like in the previous part, understanding how the workflow operates is crucial to solving the challenges:

Check your user privileges: Programs may access resources with restricted permissions based on your current user. Be sure to review what special privileges your user has.
Locate the flags: The flags are still in the /flag directory, and each flag is the password for the next level.

Additionally, just like before, you will need to leverage the programs /opt/g7, /opt/g8, and /opt/gb. Review what these programs do, check their permissions, and think about how you can use them to help you find the flags.

Good luck!!
