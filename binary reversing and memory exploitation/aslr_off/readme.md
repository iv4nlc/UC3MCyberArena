Before you start solving the challenges, it's important to understand how the workflow in this CTF operates.

Programs may access resources with limited permissions for your current user, so it’s a good idea to check what special privileges your user has. 
Additionally, the flags are located in the /flag directory, and it’s worth taking a look at them to understand how to work with them.

The flag for each level is the password for the next guess. For example, flag1 is the password for guess2.

For the completion of the final flags, where the goal is to learn how to execute programs through memory exploitation, it is necessary to use the programs `/opt/g5` and `/opt/gb`. Review what these programs do, check their permissions, and consider how you can leverage them to find the flag.
